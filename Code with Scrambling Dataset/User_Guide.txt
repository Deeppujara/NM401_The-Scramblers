"Main_code_Scrambling_Dataset.mlapp" is the main app used for checking which Scrambling Standard/Polynomial was used for Scrambling.

Step 1:
Open the app and click on the button "Choose file and Estimate" and select one scrambled dataset file.

**note : Here in this folder, there are some scrambled datasets available
(ex. CCSDS(1) and CCSDS(2) are scrambled dataset for CCSDS, DVBS(1) and DVBS(2) are scrambled dataset for DVBS,
DVBS2(1) is scrambled dataset for DVBS2 and V35(1) and V35(2) are scrambled dataset for V35)

Step 2:
When ever you will select a scrambling dataset, after some processing, it will tell you which scrambling standard is used and which polynomial is used.

Step 3:
Click on the "Reset" button for new process.
