Main file/app is "Image_Processing_App.mlapp" used for transmitting scrambled image and at the receiver, finding which scrambling standard and polynomial we have used for scrambling it.
Also to reconstruct the original image out of scrambled dataset.

Step 1:
Select "Image" option if a user want to select an image, scrambled it and transmit it.
Select "Scrambled" option it a user want to find scrambling standard and polynomial from scrambled form of an image.

Step 2:
Select which standart a user want to use for scrambling purpose.
**Note: In case of "Scrambled" option, this option will not be visible because a user already have a scrambled dataset.

Step 3:
Select which tye of Image a user want to transmit (ex. Coloured, Black and White, or a user want to use webcam for live image).

Step 4:
Click on the "Get File" option for selecting an Image(In case of "Image" option in Step 1) or for selecting a scrambled dataset(In case of "Scrambled" option in Step 1).
**Note: If you want to select an Image, then select the option "All files" in file type.

Step 5:
If "Scrambled" option is selected, then enter the value of number of rows and columns to reconstruct the same Image from scrambled data.
**Note: Some Scrambled dataset for 4-5 Images is given and there names are like "Image type_Scrambling Standard used_Coloured/B&W"
        The number of rows and columns are given for each Image in the photo "row_Column".
Step 6:
Run the code and see the output.
     
CCSDS_LFSR.mat = Matrix file containing LFSR sequence of CCSDS.
DVBS_LFSR.mat = Matrix file containing LFSR sequence of DVBS.
DVBS2_Gold_Sequence.mat = Matrix file containing gold sequence of DVBS2.
DVBS2_C-scrambled.mat = Matrix file containing C-scrambled sequence of DVBS2.

image_import.m = To import an image from user.
BW_image.m = To convert image into black and white form and for B&W form to binary bits.
Colour_image.m = To convert image into binary bits.
bits_2_image.m = To convert bits into image.
image_2_bits.m = To convert image into bits.
CCSDS_img.m = To convert image bits into CCSDS scrambled form.
DVBS_img.m = To convert image bits into DVBS scrambled form.
DVBS2_img.m = To convert image bits into DVBS2 scrambled form.
out_CCSDS.m = For checking CCSDS standard.
out_DVBS.m = For checking DVBS standard.
out_DVBS2.m = For checking DVBS2 standard.
EIGVEC.m = For Eigen analysis.
