Main File/App is "appforbits.mlapp" which is used to scramble or descramble bits using unknown primitive self-synchronous polynomial.

Step 1:
Select option "Scrambling" for scrambling the bits and "Descrambling" for descrambling.

Step 2:
Select any primitive polynomial.

Step 3:
"Select and Run" if you have any unscrambled dataset and if you want to scramble it and "Run" generate random numbers for Scrambling.

Step 4:
In Descrambling Process, first enter the value of maximum order of polynomial(m) and select a scrambled dataset.

Stet 5:
Polynomial will be displayed on "Polynomial" textbox.
